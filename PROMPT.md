**Initial project request:**
> - In this repo, we are going to learn to make a 3D engine.
> - We will be using SDL3 and C++ for this.
> - We'll be making this engine step by step, starting with the basics, and then keep adding advanced functionality.
> - Make sure all the important code pieces are well documented, so as to improve the understanding.
> - Have a 'docs' folder inside the repo, which will have documentation and tutorials to help us understand our engine.
> - Make sure to fill the CLAUDE file in this project with the preferences I have mentioned.

**Follow-up guidance (during planning):**
> - Remember, the docs should not just explain the code but also be a guide from the point of view of a graphics beginner and explain important concepts where required.
> - Remember to add this preference to the project CLAUDE file as well.

**Decisions made (via clarifying questions):**
- Rendering backend: **SDL3 GPU API** (over OpenGL).
- 3D math: **hand-rolled** (over GLM).
- First step scope: **window + clear screen** (over also rendering a triangle).
